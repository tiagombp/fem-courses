### Make a div perfectly rounded and center a single character within it

In order to achieve a perfectly round shape you'll need to have perfect square to begin with. So, for instance, your button will need to have dimensions like width: 32px; height: 32px . To turn a square into a circle you'll have to apply a border radius of 50% e.g. border-radius: 50% 

### Centraliza texto dentro de um elemento

Setting the line-height to the height of the container should do it.

### Interesting selectors
https://dev.to/ibrahima92/6-powerful-css-selectors-that-will-really-help-you-write-clean-css-4bab

1. `div > a`
This selector will enable us to select all a element where the parent element is a div tag.

2. `div + a`
This one will select every a tags placed immediately after a div element. If we have an element between the div and the a tag, that element won't be selected.

3. `div ~ a`
This one will select every a tag preceded by a div element on the same level. In other words, if the a tag is not immediately preceded by a div element, but has a div tag as a sibling element, that element will be selected.

4. `[attribute^=value]`
e.g: `[class^="list-"]`
This selector will pick every element that contains a class attribute and its value begins with list-

5. `[attribute$=value]`
e.g: `[src$=".png"]`
This one will select every src attribute where its value ends with .png.

6. `[attribute*=value]`
e.g: `[class*="-list"]`
This selector will pick every element whose class attribute contains -list. It does not matter if -list is at the beginning, the middle or at the end of the class's value. The most important is that the value must contain -list.
