With that being said, here's what I think every javascript developer should know.

0. variables, if tests, loops (duh)
1. all the Array methods on the back of their hand, and mostly: forEach, map, 2. filter, sort, reduce.
3. Functions and scope. Classes.
4. Destructuring arrays and objects, including for function arguments
5. asynchronous operations: promises, async/await syntax, fetch
6. try / catch / throw
7. That the javascript documentation is at MDN Web Docs. That the future features of JavaScript are at tc39/proposals
8. using a web framework like React, AngularJS or Vue.
9. Building an app with many files: import/export, the basic idea behind 10. transpiling (ie babeljs etc.) and building (ie webpack etc.)
11. writing tests.

Here’s what I think most people don’t need until they do.

* this, bind/apply/call
* iterators/generators
* maps and sets
* web workers
* DOM API, canvas API, … all the browser APIs
